More of a todo / idea list than a roadmap, but here goes:
====
- Note bulk downloads may be slow and need to be throttled to +- 1 per second.
- Closing a dialog should store it's last location, not just on application close

Welcome:
- reference to tutorial/about and mandatory database creation steps and updating.
- Choose a language (with flag icon) - also in settings.

Database:
- Dont use "select *" but get the exact columns
- Database updater steps:
-- Start page explaining what it's for. Press Start to start.
-- Start page, show table with current versions, if available, otherwise "no database yet", press next to download and create it.
-- First number is unix time
-- Track versions in myVersions table
- Comma separated search input, so you can search for sets "and / or"

Database updates:
- Detect if it's there, and missing the brickstack tables, or drop those tables from brickstack, then import them from the rb.db into brickstack.db
- Tell user to download and unzip the file, and place it in the import folder.
- On startup, find the file, copy the tables to our db, then delete it.
- attach db, create table as select * from src.table

Optimizations:
- Multithreading http calls for smoother user experience (mind error 429)
- Implement FastMM5 for memory leak checking and object creation performance. https://github.com/pleriche/FastMM5/releases
- Inline small functions.
- More multithreading - performing the query and convert to internal values, converting internal values to display list.
- Configure result limitation so the user cant query the whole database with one number.
- progressdialog in case an operation takes long (like import/export)
- Cleanup unused functions to keep the .exe smaller

Throttling and request slowing:
- Handle error 429: Add a mandatory delay between requests
- Request was throttled - you are sending too many requests too fast.
- Normal user accounts are allowed to send on average one request/sec, with some small allowance for burst traffic.
- Example response: { "detail": "Request was throttled. Expected available in 2 seconds." }
- Parts call: /lego/parts/?part_nums=3001,3002,3003&inc_part_details=1

Images:
- You can ask the image size you need with a suffix: https://cdn.rebrickable.com/media/thumbs/parts/elements/6020193.jpg/50x150p.jpg
-- Limits are no smaller than 2x2, no bigger than 1000x1000, anything in between is accepted.

Get user's inventory
- Ability to export inventory per group to rebrickable csv/xml

Configure desired columns when printing parts - preferably on the dialog itself by showing the config dialog and it's related settings.
- Also multiple columns - ask in dialog, and make a preview
- Color / grayscale - might not be needed since printer settings can arrange that.
- Look into Skia library https://github.com/skia4delphi/skia4delphi

Collection window:
- Import from CSV/Xml and other sources.
- Edit (change current selected row) -> show dialog with options such as: icon / name / description / custom fields
- Drag n drop to change custom order.
- Add warning on export type, that not all settings may be supported by the receiving party. With button for "dont show again"
- Support filtering by custom tag
- Give custom tags a user selectable icon
- Option to open selected collections in the same window, or a new window for each. (extra work for saving dialog dimensions)
- Right click or drag n drop (+shift) to move / add set to collection.
- Right click mark as built
- Add "all your sets" table entry to view your collection and filter from there.
- Remember column widths
- Add inventory version to set selection, so export knows what version to use rather than v1
- Support adding figures
- Support filtering separate figures or all figures in your sets.
- Text filter (show/hide text matches by name)
- Export parts.
- Export parts lists across multiple sets or inventories. so you can easily order what you need.
- Invert selection - so you can select what you are missing and then invert.
- Show owned sets. Show > in front of owned sets in case of multiple, and open as tree view.
-- Sub-setlists, in collections screen.
- Select / Edit parts from this window only. (update help to reflect this) Stored between sessions.

Parts window:
- Left click to add
- Right click to remove
- checkbox to select all or remove all.
- Implement display filters
- Fix printing, again.

Settings:
- Add option to show/hide columns for collection / setlist.
- Add ability to add custom fields.
- Option to store backup files on changes / periodically.
- Slider setting for delay between image downloads.
- Search options box above treeview.
- Caps lock is active warning in login dialog
- Add configurable behaviour for doubleclick: "view part" / "view set" -> "ask" / "rebrickable" / "other" / "custom"
- Default import / export path (just remember last used)
- Option to allow multiple collections windows
- Option to allow multiple collection windows
- Check for updates / autoupdater (we dont have a webserver, so no auto updates anytime soon)
- Sliders for default image quality for parts / sets / other. Too high by default, limit is 1000px 128 for parts and 256 for models would be better as default.
- Choose UI elements in search results / parts (several template layouts, with example)

Windows:
- Collection details (shows selected collection's details / custom fields / statistics)
- Collection content (shows selected collection's set content)
- Multiple collections (vertical and horizontal)
- Remember checkbox mode and checks between sessions
-- Reimagine checklist mode as a table with wider spacing so we can handle more data?
- "layout" set for all windows to switch window placements configured by the user.
- Hamburger menu if window size is too thin.
- Expand about screen
- Fix window sizes and anchors
- Helpfile / tutorial / common shortcuts
- Sorting grids

Export collection:
- Choose format
- Choose overwrite / keep

Export set parts:
- CSV

Import collection:
- Choose format
- Choose overwrite / keep

Logging:
- Optional log files for communication and debugging.
- Make sure passwords are not logged to the _token endpoint
- Make sure any token is not logged.

Search:
- Option to show search as image panels or table with text, and image on hover
- Prevent text overlap (cut off by replacing text with ..."
- Search add next results button.
- Also to future part search dialogs
- When searching for minifigs, also search "in sets"
- Configure next/prev page results, in case results are a lot. (limit 10 offset 10) or load while scrolling.
- "3001pr004" and other parts with different external references does not allow part lookup at this time.
-- Should be available in the API
- Add "force refresh from external" button for sets under a setlist.

Search parts in:
- Search for parts in sets, to find sets

Analytics:
- Show graphs of each theme / year / part count of sets you own

Known issues:
- Selecting a grid cell at the bottom, scrolls all the way to the bottom of the search result.
- Some images are named ".jpg" but are actually bitmaps, or png.
