#BrickStack
----
Keep an eye on development through my ReBrickable workbench:

* https://rebrickable.com/users/tstki/workbench/

Before starting, get the SSL libraries. (We can't distribute those due to complex export restrictions)

* https://en.delphipraxis.net/topic/4776-where-i-can-find-the-ssl-dlls-for-indy/
* https://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/

Make sure you get the latest (1.0.2u+) 32/64 bit version depending on the version of BrickStack.

#Help it doesn't work

* Throw away your BrickStack.ini to get back default settings.
